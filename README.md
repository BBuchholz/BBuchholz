- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BBuchholz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software projects that try to bridge the gap between realms, whether that gap is the one between the digital and the analog, the physical and the mental or the mental and the spiritual. I want to collaborate on theses endeavors, promise I will update this eventually, always busy on projects and such but I try to update this from time to time 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and using Vue 3, previous attempts exist here in other languages and frameworks but for the current endeavors the focus is Vue and Javascript (with plans to bring forward accumulated datasets from those previous incarnations in other languages)
